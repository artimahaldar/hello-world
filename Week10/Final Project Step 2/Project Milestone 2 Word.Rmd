## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars1}
## Load the `data/r4ds/heights.csv` to
#install.packages("readxl")
library("readxl")

#the excel sheet below represent Crypto Current Market Cap Data

cryptodata <- read_excel('C:/Users/Sandeep Raina/Documents/dsc520/data/Cryptocurrency.xlsx')

#What are different ways you could look at this data to answer the questions you want to answer?
### Functions to clean and examine the data frame
dim(cryptodata)
str(cryptodata)
summary(cryptodata)
colnames(cryptodata)
```
```{r cars}
### The head() and tail() functions default to 6 rows, but we can adjust the number of rows using the "n = " argument

head(cryptodata, n = 12)
tail(cryptodata, n = 6)

#Do you plan to slice and dice the data in different ways, create new variables, or join separate data frames to create new summary information? Explain.
library("dplyr")
step_1_df <- select(cryptodata, -Volume)
dim(step_1_df)

head(step_1_df, n = 10)
#Arrange

step_2_df <-step_1_df %>% arrange(step_1_df$MarketCap, step_1_df$CryptoCurrencyname)
## Warning: Unknown or uninitialised column: `CryptoCurrencyname`.
head(step_2_df)
#How could you summarize your data to answer key questions?
filter_df <- cryptodata %>% filter(Currencyname == "dixasset")
filter_df
Mean_Market_cap_df <- summarize(filter_df,mean(MarketCap,na.rm=TRUE))

cryptodata_Group <- group_by(cryptodata,Currencyname)
summarize(cryptodata_Group,avg= mean(MarketCap,na.rm=TRUE))
#What types of plots and tables will help you to illustrate the findings to your questions? Ensure #that all graph plots have axis titles, legend if necessary, scales are appropriate, appropriate #geoms used, etc.).
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = cryptodata_Group, aes(x=Currencyname,y=Volume)) + geom_boxplot()
#
#Machine Learning technique that helps in answering the question and the group to which the data belongs to is Classification.

#Classification in machine learning is a process of identifying to which of the set a group of experimental observations belongs.

#This is mainly done with the help of training set which contains pre-installed data and the those data are classified on the basis of some categories.

#Classification is very important for solving complex mathematical and statistical problems.
```
Note that the echo = FALSE parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
