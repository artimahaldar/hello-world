## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

## Load the `data/r4ds/heights.csv` to
#install.packages("readxl")
library("readxl")

#the excel sheet below represent Crypto Current Market Cap Data

cryptodata <- read_excel('C:/Users/Sandeep Raina/Documents/dsc520/data/Cryptocurrency.xlsx')

#here is the structure of the data
summary(cryptodata)
#Data preparation and cleansing steps.
# 1. Familiarize yourself with the data set
file.info('C:/Users/Sandeep Raina/Documents/dsc520/data/Cryptocurrency.xlsx')$size
#File Size - 33921675 bytes
#an initial look at the data frame
str(cryptodata)
#2 . Check for structural errors  - we will ll evaluate the data frame for structural errors. These include entry errors such as faulty data types, non-unique ID numbers, mislabeled variables, and string inconsistencies. 
#If there are more structural pitfalls in your own dataset than the ones covered below, be sure to include additional steps in your data cleaning to address the idiosyncrasies.

#install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
cryptodata <- cryptodata %>% rename(CryptoCurrencyname = Currencyname)
#Examine if datatypes are faulty
typeof(cryptodata$MarketCap)
#Non-unique ID numbers - In this dataset uniqueness is not a problem#3 .Check for data irregularities, like invalid values and outliers
summary(cryptodata)
#Data look ok
#4: Decide how to deal with missing values
sum(is.na(cryptodata))
#percent missing values per variable
apply(cryptodata, 2, function(col)sum(is.na(col))/length(col))
#identifying the rows with NAs
cryptodata_NA <- rownames(cryptodata)[apply(cryptodata, 2,anyNA)]
summary(cryptodata_NA)
#removing all observations with NAs
cryptodata_clean <- cryptodata %>% na.omit()
#Clean Data Set
summary(cryptodata_clean)
#Discuss how you plan to uncover new information in the data that is not self-evident.
#install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = cryptodata_clean, aes(x=CryptoCurrencyname,y=Volume)) + geom_boxplot()








```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
