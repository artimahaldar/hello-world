## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#install.packages("readxl")
library("readxl")

#the excel sheet below represent Crypto Current Market Cap Data

cryptodata <- read_excel('C:/Users/Sandeep Raina/Documents/dsc520/data/Cryptocurrency.xlsx')

#here is the structure of the data

summary(cryptodata)
```
```{r cars1}
#The problem statement addressed. 

#This data set shows the MarketCap for various Crypto Currencies, date wise High low and Open and close.
#This data can help us understand how each curries has changed in last few years and how the market cap has been for each of them.
#That can help us anlayze how volatile each one of them is and answer few research question:
#Which cryptocurrencies are best for investing in the current time.
#What mix of cryptocurrency in portfolio can yeild hight return.
#Are cryptocurrency subject to specultation risk?
str(cryptodata)
#How you addressed this problem statement
#First data needs to be cleaned 
#Check for structural errors  - weâ€™ll evaluate the data frame for structural errors. These include entry errors such as faulty data types, non-unique ID numbers, mislabeled variables, and string inconsistencies. 
#If there are more structural pitfalls in your own dataset than the ones covered below, be sure to include additional steps in your data cleaning to address the idiosyncrasies.

#install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
cryptodata <- cryptodata %>% rename(CryptoCurrencyname = Currencyname)

#Examine if datatypes are faulty
typeof(cryptodata$MarketCap)
#Non-unique ID numbers - In this dataset uniqueness is not a problem

#Check for data irregularities, like invalid values and outliers. 

summary(cryptodata)
#Data look ok

#Decide how to deal with missing values

sum(is.na(cryptodata))
#percent missing values per variable
apply(cryptodata, 2, function(col)sum(is.na(col))/length(col))
#identifying the rows with NAs
cryptodata_NA <- rownames(cryptodata)[apply(cryptodata, 2, anyNA)]

summary(cryptodata_NA)
#removing all observations with NAs
cryptodata_clean <- cryptodata %>% na.omit()

#Clean Data Set
summary(cryptodata_clean)
head(cryptodata_clean)
#max(currencydata_clean$MarketCap)


#install.packages("matrixStats")
library(matrixStats)
#currencydata_clean %>% rowwise() %>% mutate(Maximum_price = max(c(currencydata_clean$MarketCap)))

##Summarize how you addressed this problem statement (the data used and the methodology employed, including a recommendation for a model that could be implemented). 

#What are different ways you could look at this data to answer the questions you want to answer?

#There are various steps followed below to uncover the data 

#Discuss how you plan to uncover new information in the data that is not self-evident.

#install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = cryptodata_clean, aes(x=CryptoCurrencyname,y=Volume)) + geom_boxplot()



```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
