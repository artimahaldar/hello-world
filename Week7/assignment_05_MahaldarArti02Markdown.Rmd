#3. Choose the type of correlation test to perform, explain why you chose this test, and make a prediction if the test yields a positive or negative correlation?

#Correlation method can be pearson, spearman or kendall

#The pearson correlation coefficient measure the linear dependence between two variables.

#If method is âkendallâ or âspearmanâ, Kendallâs tau or Spearmanâs rho statistic is used to estimate a rank-based measure of association. These are more robust and have been recommended if the data do not come from a bivariate normal distribution.

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
